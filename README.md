# SimScaleTests

The packages contain the files for the different tasks. 

<h2>Task 1: Unit Test Assignment</h2>

done!


<h2>Task 2: Integration Test Assignment</h2>




<h2>Task 3: UI Testing Assignment</h2>

done!

All tests can be run using the "AllTestsSuite". To be able to execute them, vaild Username and Password for the SimScale site have to be specified in SimScaleTests/uiTestingAssignment/util/CommonParameters.java.

As a prerequisite the following is needed (but can be modified easily in the common parameters):
The first 3 tutorial projects have to be created and be named:
"Tutorial-01: Connecting rod stress analysis"
"Tutorial-02: Pipe junction flow"
"Tutorial-03: Differential casing thermal analysis"
"Tutorial-02" project has to have a geometry named "CAD-pipe-junction_v1"

Notes regarding the test cases:

Sub-Task 4: Visualizing a geometry: 
While it is possible to compare to images, I don't think the effort id not feasible for an assignment. Although the outcome would be very interesting. Therefore I would be happy to do this, when hired. ;)

Sub-Task 5: There where several steps missing in the test specification and the prerequisite has to be changed:

** Starting from (4) "Visualizing a Geometry" //not (2) as mentioned in the task description

** click on "Mesh Geometry". 

** In the Mesh Operation Panel press "Start" 

** In the confirmation dialog , press "yes" 

** ...
